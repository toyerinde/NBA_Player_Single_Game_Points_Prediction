# NBA_Player_Single_Game_Points_Prediction
Building a winning National Basketball Association (NBA) rotation is a conundrum every NBA coach faces. Coaches have historically relied on their experience, player’s strengths and opponent’s weaknesses to plan their game day roster but with the advances made in the field of sport analytics, analytics is now playing a significant role in the game day planning process. Key to putting a winning rotation together is knowing each player's scoring potential. This project aims to address this key unknown by utilizing basketball shot data to predict single game points for each player on an NBA team. Having this knowledge ahead of each game will arm NBA coaches with vital data driven information that would lead to better game day strategies and more winning rotations.

In this project, I built a Poisson model to predict single game points for each NBA player on a specific team. The team of interest for this project is the Los Angeles Clippers(LAC) with focus on the 2025 season team's top three game scorers ( James Harden, Kawhi Leonard and Norman Powell). Although this project's focus was on the LAC team, the Poisson model can be easilly updated to predict single game points for any other NBA team.
